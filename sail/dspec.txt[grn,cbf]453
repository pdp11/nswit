Disk controller to connect an industry standard "Storage Module" interface
compatible disk drive (such as Ampex 9300) to Digital Equipment Corporation
(henceforth DEC) LSI-11 "Q-bus" (henceforth Q-Bus).
  The following features are required:
  1) Controller should mount entirely in standard LSI-11 chassis.  Must not
     require external chassis.
  2) Must control at least 2 disk drives.
  3) Capable of reading and writing data on using all heads, and on all the
     tracks of any disk that stores 20,160 bytes per track and uses an
     industry standard Storage Module type interface.  Furthermore, at least
     16,384 bytes of the 20,160 bytes per track shall be capable of being
     read and written.
  4) Be immune to data loss due to Q-Bus contention.  (Eg. via full sector
     buffers in disk controller).
  5) Support disk transfer rates of at least 2.0 Megabytes per second and
     be capable of sustaining said transfer rate for a full track (at least
     16,384 bytes) into a DEC MSV11-D memory.
  6) Store and process error correction and detection information in sector
     headers capable of correcting at least 1 11-bit burst error per sector
     and detecting longer or more frequent errors.
  7) Provide means of detecting errors in disk header information at least
     as reliable as a 16-bit Cyclic Redunancy Check.
  8) Allow for controlling at least 6 drives from a single Q-Bus backplane,
     in a flexible fashion.

     For example, if each disk controller attaches up to 2 disk drives,
     then it must be possible to mount at least 3 disk controller units in
     1 backplane.  This would also mean that the units must be capable of
     being configured to respond to up to 3 different control register
     addresses.  The choice between these control register addresses must
     be field selectable,  either by jumpers, switches, or at worst,
     changing PROM sets.  If by changing PROM sets an assortment of PROMs
     must be provided allowing at least 1 alternate choice for each
     board purchased.

  9) Be capable of data transfers to any location in the full 18 bit
     Q-Bus address space.
 10) Support the customary range of control functions and error status
     indicators for a PDP11 disk controller.  Emulation of a specific
     DEC disk controller is not required.
 11) Require no more than 10 Amps at +5V and 1 Amp at +12V to be taken
     from standard pins on backplane.
 12) Support Storage Module Interface signals necesary for assuming and
     releasing control of a dual-ported disk drive.
 13) Provide programs to diagnose disk and controller and format disk
     media.  Programs should be supplied on DEC RX01 compatible floppy
     disks.  Programs should either run under DEC RT-11 operating system
     or run standalone.

Preference will be given to products that:
  1) take up the least backplane space per disk drive supported.
  2) use an error correction technique on header information (i.e., similar
     to requirement for data) instead of the CRC technique.
  3) support more than the minimum requireement of 6 disk drives per
     backplane.
  4) allow wide range of control register address, interrupt vector
     selection and interrupt priority via more convenient means.  (I.e.
     switches are more convenient than jumpers which are more convenient
     than PROM replacement).
  5) minimize head to head switching times.
  6) provide error detection/correction techniques capable of detecting and
     correcting more than one 11-bit burst error per sector.
  7) provide for selection and per track variation of sector size during
     formatting.
  8) provide software driver for use under DEC RT-11 V4 operating system.

Requirements for bid:
  In addition to indicating compliance or non-compliance to each of the
  requireed items, vendor should provide standard programming and
  installation manuals for product as part of bid.  These will be used
  by project staff to judge conformance with requirement 10.  Vendor
  should indicate to what extent and in what fashion its product
  provides preferred features.
